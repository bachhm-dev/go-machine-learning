Machine Learning Overview
# Introduction to Machine Learning Techniques

This README provides an introduction to simple machine learning techniques, including:

- Linear Regression
- Classification
- Clustering
- Time Series Analysis
- Anomaly Detection

## Linear Regression
Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting continuous values. It establishes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable.

## Classification
Classification is a supervised learning technique used to categorize data into predefined classes or labels. It is commonly used for tasks such as spam detection, sentiment analysis, and image recognition.

## Clustering
Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique used to group similar data points together based on their characteristics. It helps in identifying patterns and structures within the data.

## Time Series Analysis
Time series analysis is a statistical technique used to analyze and forecast data points collected over time. It is commonly used in financial forecasting, weather prediction, and stock market analysis.

## Anomaly Detection
Anomaly detection is a technique used to identify unusual or abnormal data points that deviate from the expected patterns. It is widely used in fraud detection, network security, and system monitoring.

This README aims to provide a brief overview of these machine learning techniques and their applications. For more detailed information and implementation examples, please refer to the respective sections in the documentation.
