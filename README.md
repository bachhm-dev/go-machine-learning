# Introduction to Machine Learning Techniques

This README provides an introduction to simple machine learning techniques, including:

- Linear Regression
- Classification
- Clustering
- Time Series Analysis
- Anomaly Detection

## Regression

A method used to analyze and make predictions based on summary statistics or aggregated data rather than individual data points. It is commonly used when raw data is unavailable, but summary information such as means, variances, and correlations can still provide insights.

1. **Linear Regression**

    Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting continuous values. It establishes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable.

2. **Multiple linear regression**

    Multiple linear regression is not limited to simple formulas of lines that depend on only one independent variable. It is an extension of simple linear regression which involves two or more independent variables.

## Classification

Classification is a supervised learning technique used to categorize data into predefined classes or labels. It is commonly used for tasks such as spam detection, sentiment analysis, and image recognition.

1. **Logistic regression**

    Logistic regression is a statistical method used in machine learning for binary classification problems, where the outcome (dependent variable) is categorical and typically takes one of two values (e.g., 0 or 1, true or false, yes or no).

## Clustering

Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique used to group similar data points together based on their characteristics. It helps in identifying patterns and structures within the data.

## Time Series Analysis

Time series analysis is a statistical technique used to analyze and forecast data points collected over time. It is commonly used in financial forecasting, weather prediction, and stock market analysis.

## Anomaly Detection

Anomaly detection is a technique used to identify unusual or abnormal data points that deviate from the expected patterns. It is widely used in fraud detection, network security, and system monitoring.
